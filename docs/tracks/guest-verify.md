# lp/guest-verify

**Goal.** Will's fifth batch (2026-09-19, build `69a9a17`) answered the four boards at the head of the desk; this lane is one of ten cut from it. His verdicts and every note are in `docs/reviews/<board>.json` and verbatim in `docs/design/rulings.md` (the
section "the fifth batch"); the Orchestrator's reading of every verdict is below under "The verdict map", and this lane's
brief follows it. Read the brief end to end before the first edit; where it says "his to overrule", build the recommended
answer and list it in the Handoff.

## The brief (from the Orchestrator's plan; the bracketed line numbers are the tree at `69a9a177`)

- His ask by name (the whole `gate` note verbatim in the brief). A new board on the guest door with the real facts:
  today `events.allow_anonymous_uploads` (default false = accounts required), the account step is Supabase Auth OTP
  (`email-sign-in.tsx:89`, a code and a magic link, `verifyOtp`), the hard gate is Postgres (`create_guest` raises when
  the event requires an account and the caller has none or an unconfirmed email), a failed send is one toast and a
  Resend button, and nothing in the product distinguishes a verified guest from an unverified one (`guests.user_id`
  the only proxy; the "verified-at-join" invariant: the email is read from `auth.users`, never the client). Six
  decisions, drawn on the real guest door, the guest list, the faces row (with `seed-avatar`'s orbs as the fallback) and
  the host's review queue (never `/admin`, the `admin` board's ground), phone first, with one fact every `outage` option
  draws: Supabase Auth OTP is rate-limited per email and per IP and a venue's shared network is ONE IP: `gate` (confirm before the upload, as today / upload now and
  confirm later, the upload marked / upload now, held for the host until confirmed), `badge` (what an unverified account
  shows on its avatar and in the guest list: a mark, a dimmed ring, nothing), `collision` (someone enters an email that
  exists unverified: claim it by confirming, a fresh account, refuse), `outage` (what happens when the code never
  arrives: a bypass the host set, a grace window, a second channel), `host-lens` (what the host sees and controls:
  "require confirmed emails" per event as today, a review filter for unverified, a badge in the queue; what an unverified
  account may not do, caps, rate, no downloads, no claims, is the cost line on every option, not a decision), and `expiry` (media from an account that never
  confirms: held seven days then removed, or kept as anonymous; the one question with a data-loss cost). Every option
  states its security cost against `docs/systems/database-security.md` and the anti-abuse invariants (storage caps, the
  host's setting as the host's protection); the recommended answers explicit. The security picture the board must DRAW
  rather than describe: the collision is about sessions, not emails. If A uploads under bob@x unverified and the real
  Bob later confirms bob@x, Bob must not inherit A's uploads; unverified uploads bind to the session's guest row
  (today's anonymous path, `guests.user_id` null), confirmation by the same session claims them (`claimAnonymousUploads`
  exists), confirmation by another session orphans them: a two-lane flow picture (session-bound against email-bound)
  as the `collision` step's stage. `gate=held` rides the existing `pending` status (auto-approve on confirm when
  moderation is off); `outage`'s strongest option is the host's time-boxed switch on the settings sheet ("let everyone
  in for three hours"), SMS costing money and PII; the `badge` step draws BOTH a guest-visible mark (his words, "on
  avatars") and a host-only one, with the cost written on the frame (an "unverified" mark on a guest album's faces row
  reads as "suspect" to other guests). No production byte; a proposed migration only as a written proposal.
  Registers at the head of `DESK_ORDER` (the Orchestrator moves it after `guest-shape` at the merge: it changes the
  guest door every guest board draws).
- Owns `src/app/(dev)/design/sandbox/guest-verify/` and its registration lines. Reads: `guest-flow.md`, `auth-accounts.md`,
  `database-security.md`, `enter-event-prompt.tsx`, `email-sign-in.tsx`, `entry-modal.tsx`, `uploads-section.tsx`, the
  two migrations named, `uploader-identity.ts`, `guest-list.tsx`, `sandbox/seed-avatar/gradient.ts` (the orb).

## The verdict map (every answer of the batch; this lane wires only its own board's)

**`voice` r1 (eight; the board RETIRES at its wiring, its voice written up from the wins):**
- `absence=named` + his rewrite: bible 20 is ruled PERMISSIVE (naming an absence a guest is wary of is allowed; the rule
  forbids defining Partyreel against something else, "we're not cloud storage, we're not vsco") AND the line changes
  everywhere: "No app, no account." becomes "No app required." because accounts may be required. The Orchestrator
  rewrites bible 20's `statement` and `why` in `rules/bible.ts` at the batch record (his words); the lane sweeps the 66 lines
  (every "no account" promise goes; "no app" stays as a benefit).
- `hero-sub=?` with his line: `SITE_SUBHEAD` becomes "Your guests took the best photos and videos at your event. Partyreel
  collects them with one easy link. No more chasing group chats the next day." (verbatim). `SITE_DESCRIPTION` (thesis +
  subhead) would reach ~200 characters: the lane gives the meta description its own line under 160 and says so.
- `feature-h1=today`: nothing moves; his "I do not like three-line headings on desktop" becomes a measurement on the
  alias of all six feature h1s at 1440 (`PageHero` `lg` = `text-title`, 80 px in `max-w-3xl`, likely two to three lines)
  and a proposal in the Handoff for any that wrap to three (shorter h1 copy, never the load-bearing width).
- `pro-line=video` with his line: "For videos and unlimited events." at `plan-cards.tsx:316`, single-sourced beside the
  other ruled lines in `marketing-voice.ts`; the four sibling one-liners (`pricing-teaser.tsx:37`, `faq-data.ts:47`,
  `how-much-fits.tsx:154`, `llms.ts:133,233`) aligned to the same order (videos first, unlimited events); two or three
  "slightly more engaging" phrasings offered in the Handoff for his overrule on the alias.
- `host-empty=album`: "Your first album starts here" in `events-empty-teaser.tsx:41-43`; its body line loses "No app, no
  account"; the CTA stays "Create your first event" into the wizard.
- `gate=ask` with his adjustment: the body of `enter-event-prompt.tsx:56-59` becomes "For safety, the host has requested
  you confirm your email. One tap and you're in." (verbatim; the eyebrow, the title and the password path unchanged). His
  "big one" (skip confirmation for a badge) is the `guest-verify` exploration below, not this lane.
- `empty=starts`: "The album starts with you" in `gallery-empty-state.tsx:69-76`; the CTA "Be the first to add a photo" stays.
- `moment=today`: `guest-upload.tsx:77` unchanged. His "redesign our toasts" is the `toasts` exploration below.
- The finding to write up (the lane, in `marketing-voice.ts`'s head comment and `docs/systems/`): the two deliberately
  identical questions (`host-empty`, `empty`) got one voice, the album noun and "starts".

**`body-type` r1 (seven; six wire now, `buttons` goes to round two on the same board):**
- `reading=16` (every guest-facing sentence; the 26 `text-[15px]` go), `working=14` (the app's body; the admin "can break
  away" toward density, so the admin's own sizes are mapped where equal and otherwise left for the `admin` board),
  `marketing=fluid` (16 at a phone to 18 at a desk, a clamp like the heading steps), `caption=10` read with his note as
  TWO bottom steps: the caption step stays 12 (the labels he named) and a `micro` step at 10 is the FLOOR (the event
  cards' metadata chips, count pips; nothing under 10 outside depicted type), `label=12-08` (every uppercase label,
  marketing and app, at 12 px on 0.08em; the Eyebrow atom and the 75 `tracking-[0.14em]` literals move; he may drop to 11
  later), `leading=length` (2 x size - 8: 10/12, 12/16, 14/20, 16/24, 18/28; the marketing clamp's leading a clamp too).
- `buttons=ladder` "not a direct selection, more work required": round two on `buttons` alone (below); the wiring lane
  leaves Button's sizes as today (the `sm` literal stays until the rung is ruled).
- The write-up: the steps as tokens with leading and tracking companions in `theme.css` beside the heading steps,
  `TYPE_STEPS` and `cn()` knowing them, the policy test extended from headings to body sizes (stock classes that equal a
  step are on the ladder; px literals and off-step stock sizes fail; depicted type and the named exceptions exempt), the
  Library's foundations page, `design-system.md`'s type section refined in place.

**`glass` r1 (seven; the recipe goes to round two FIRST, the wiring follows it in one lane):**
- `recipe=frost` with "worth a second round ... so we can nail our glass from the start", `reel=white` with "may be worth
  exploring making this the standard - I don't want to have separate glass treatments and would prefer to find a global
  that works everywhere": round two asks the ONE material (Frost, Crystal, White-on-Frost) on every glass surface at once.
- `grades=one`, `behind=album` (the album blurred at half brightness behind the lightbox), `row=bar` (one pane holding the
  host's three controls), `paper=dark` (dark glass over media whatever the theme): rulings that wire with the material.
- `tiles=?` with his rule: on a mobile image card nothing but an active like mark, a video play mark and a subtle like
  count (state, never a control); every action (like, download, select, hide) lives in the lightbox's controls, select
  handling multi-item. A standing ruling for `media-viewer`, `app-vocabulary`, `guest-shape` and `host-curation` (the
  carried call below), wired by the glass lane on the tiles it owns and by `media-viewer`'s wiring in the lightbox.

**`app-shape` r1 (eight; two wiring lanes now, round two on the home across host states; the board stays):**
- `home=pulse`: `/dashboard` becomes the front page ("what needs you, then what just arrived": the waiting queues and the
  storage line first, the photographs of the last hour, then your events); the five-chip inbox (`dashboard-feed.tsx`,
  `filter-chips.tsx`) goes. His "worth more dashboard explorations ... across all host states" is round two (below).
- `density=cover` + "let's do both": the events list keeps the cover cards AND gains a row/table view behind a toggle
  aligned right opposite "Your events" (sorting and filtering in the table); the choice persists per host; the board's
  `lands` says every list of events in the app (the bin, saved events, the hosts you follow) shares the shape.
- `event=hub` + his three additions: a row of cards (Review, Reel, Guests, Settings LAST; the board's "Album" card becomes
  Settings), the gallery BELOW the cards by default in most-recent order, a clickable QR code horizontally centred to the
  left of the title + metadata stack that opens the share mini-modal.
- `nav=crumbs`: a trail in the bar (Partyreel / the event / the room), the cards row going sticky as the album scrolls
  ("could pick up sticky-style from the cards"), and a creative way to keep Share reachable from the sticky row.
- `share=room` overridden by his `settings` note: sharing gets ONE comprehensive surface as a SHEET (the code, the link,
  the posters, the invite, the custom link claim, anything future), reached from the event's menu and from the mini-modal;
  the QR at the left of the title opens a view-transition-style mini-modal (a bigger scannable code, view/copy the link,
  a door to the sheet); a third, subtler event link with a copy button sits under the metadata line.
- `settings=sheet`: the settings page of cards becomes a sheet over the album (the album stays behind it); the photo bin
  joins the album as a filter; "Deleted" names one thing.
- `you=?` with his answer: a person's own photos, likes and connections live on the PROFILE page (an owner mode of
  `/u/[slug]`), where the avatar and profile settings can also be changed; plans, billing and profile management live on
  the ACCOUNT page (billing gets its first door: a Plan card); the avatar may be changed in both places. The user menu
  gets the two doors. The personal feeds leave the home.
- `phone=same`: one shape at both sizes, the crumb header narrowed, the cards row scrolling sideways with a conditional
  gradient at either edge, sticky after the page scrolls past the cards.

## The ownership rules every lane follows this round

- One manifest owner per path; no two lanes' `owns` overlap, not even by a shared prefix. A second lane's single-line
  edit in another lane's file rides the lane-check exception line of its Handoff ("exceptions and why"), applied AFTER
  syncing past the owner's merge, never before. `merge-lane.sh` aborts only on real git conflicts (same or adjacent
  lines, a delete against a modify), so distinct hunks merge clean; the pre-handoff sync carries the first lane's hunks.
- `ladder-wiring` owns explicit FILES (its real footprint, about seventy: `git grep -lE
  'text-\[(7|8|9|11|13|15|17)px\]|text-\[0\.8rem\]|tracking-\[0\.14em\]' -- src ':!src/app/(dev)'`), never a prefix
  another lane sits under; a file whose only sizes are stock classes equal to a step needs no edit at all.
- The app-shape lanes build on stock classes that EQUAL a step (`text-sm` 14, `text-xs` 12, `text-base` 16,
  `text-[10px]`) and never on the announced step names: Tailwind v4 emits no utility for an undeclared `--text-working`,
  the element silently inherits, and nothing in the gate sees it. The names are a mechanical swap after a lane syncs
  past the ladder's merge, or a follow-up.
- A wiring lane never deletes, renames or breaks the props of a module the lab imports: every module
  `git grep -l "from \"@/" src/app/\(dev\)` resolves to (`filter-chips`, `trash-section`, `storage-meter`, `feed-section`,
  `empty-section-teaser`, `event-card`, `app-shell`, `feed-section-header`, `event-filter-pills`, `review-section`,
  `use-review-triage`, `recently-deleted-grid`, `event-settings/*`, `event-slug-control`, `my-uploads-gallery`,
  `lib/dashboard/filters.ts`, `media-grid`, `host-selection-provider`, `review-actions`, `gallery-actions`, `styled-qr`,
  `host-media-grid`, `export-dialog`, `download-all-button`, `selectable-media-grid`, `review-grid`, `feed-section-empty`,
  `qr-preset-picker`, `enter-event-prompt`, `gallery-empty-state`, `likes-provider`, `password-gate`, and more): a retired file stays on disk with a head comment
  naming the boards that draw it; `AppShell` and `EventCard` props stay backward compatible; `pnpm design:rules` when
  `component-notes.ts`'s AppShell contract changes.
- `docs/systems/host-app.md` is split by heading: `home-wiring` edits inside `## Dashboard landing`, `## Events & the
  create flow`, `## First-time host welcome`; `hub-wiring` inside `## QR designer`, `## Custom event link (slug)`, `## The
  event page`, `## Moderation & curation` and one Reel-card door line in `## Reel curation`; nobody touches the H1, the
  ROLE block or `## See also` (the Orchestrator rewrites the H1 at the record); edits stay inside a section body, never
  on a heading line or the blank line before the next heading; the second lane to land syncs first.
- `src/lib/single-source-policy.test.ts` refuses one UPPER_SNAKE export from two `src/lib` modules: `home-wiring`'s
  `lib/dashboard/*` and `hub-wiring`'s `lib/event/*` never both export a `SECTION_LABEL`; `voice-wiring` deletes the four
  sibling Pro lines rather than re-exporting one.
- `content/help/` and `content/blog/` belong to `voice-wiring` alone. The app-shape lanes change what several help
  articles describe (the dashboard, the event page, sharing, settings): each lists the articles it makes stale in its
  Handoff (help how-tos track shipped reality), and one `help-sync` follow-up (Sonnet) rewrites them after both land.
- Every new door a wiring lane adds (the QR and its mini-modal, the copy button, the list toggle, the menu rows, the
  cards) carries `trackAttrs` as the chrome's doors do; every new component gets its `for` line in
  `rules/component-notes.ts` and a `// @contract-for:` test, so it lands in the Library with its `new` badge
  (`pnpm design:rules`); the sheets, the mini-modal and the table read `ui/floating-layer.ts`.
- ONE responsive Sheet for the product (a side panel at a desk, a bottom sheet in a hand, on `ui/sheet.tsx` with
  `ui/drawer.tsx` retired or folded): `hub-wiring` builds it for settings and sharing, and it is the sheet
  `guest-shape`'s dialogs, `profile-page`'s quick-look and `app-pricing`'s object inherit ("apply this sheet concept
  everywhere"); its contract test is the one others reuse.

**Binds.** The bible (`/design/library`), the contracts of every component under a path you own, and the policies;
Will's notes in the ledger and rulings.md; the ownership rules above; CLAUDE.md's working loop (doc-check via Context7
first: Next 16, Tailwind v4, zod v4 and Supabase SSR drift). `DESIGN_PREVIEW_KEY` rides the environment, never a command
line. Never edit a record doc (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ASSETS.md`, `docs/tracks/orchestrator.md`,
`docs/design/rulings.md`, `docs/reviews/`); a `docs/systems/` fact inside your lane is refined in place and listed below.
Stage explicitly; never `--no-verify` or force-push; the `Co-Authored-By` trailer on every commit.

**Verify on.** For a production lane: the gate on the synced tree (`pnpm design:rules`, the specimen collector
`node "src/app/(dev)/design/gallery/collect-specimens.mjs"`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` with the 8 known warnings, `pnpm test`,
`pnpm build`), each on its own exit code; `pnpm lab:smoke --base http://localhost:<your port>` whole; the surfaces the Handoff is
judged on, local at 1440 and 375 (the Orchestrator red-teams them on the alias). For a lab lane: the board at 1440 and 375 with
reduced motion honoured, `pnpm lab:smoke` whole, `pnpm lab:demo --board <board> --base http://localhost:<your port>` pressing
every step (a backdrop-filter step reports UNPAINTED in headless Chrome: capture it by hand and say so). One process at a
time on this machine; your dev server on your own port, killed by port before a build, a test run and the handoff.
