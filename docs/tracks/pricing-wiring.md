# lp/pricing-wiring

**Goal.** Will's sixth batch (2026-09-20, build `806695d`) answered the next five boards on the desk and glass round two, and a second paste the same hour answered the demo and the pricing page; this lane is one of eight cut from them, on the seam the Orchestrator landed first. His verdicts and every note are in `docs/reviews/<board>.json` and verbatim in `docs/design/rulings.md` (the
section "the sixth batch"); the Orchestrator's reading of every verdict is below under "The verdict map", and this lane's
brief follows it. Read the brief end to end before the first edit; where it says "his to overrule", build the recommended
answer and list it in the Handoff.

## The brief (from the Orchestrator's plan; the bracketed line numbers are the tree at `806695d1`)

- Owns `src/app/(marketing)/(paper)/pricing/`
(or wherever `pricing/page.tsx` lives: the lane check names it), `src/components/marketing/sections/pricing/`
(`plan-cards.tsx`, `pass-card.tsx`, `calculator.tsx`, the unlock grid, the shared band retired on disk if the lab
draws it, the FAQ block), `pricing-faq-data.ts`, the pricing lines of `docs/systems/marketing-content.md`. Reads,
never edits: `src/lib/constants/tiers.ts` (the sizes and cadence the slider walks: the one source), `marketing-voice.ts`
(`PRO_LINE`), the checkout doors (their targets unchanged; Stripe stays TEST), `sandbox/pricing-page/` (round two's).
The chapter rhythm: paper opening, the pair and the Pass, the dark tiles chapter, "Find your plan size" as today, the
dark table, the accordion, the band. Tests: the FAQ count and the JSON-LD parity, the slider's steps equal `tiers.ts`,
the cadence toggle above the slider, `marketing-h1-policy`, `content-policy`; the gate. Red-team on the alias signed
out at 1440 and 375: the whole page, the slider, the dark chapters' transitions, the accordion, the Pass beneath.
His to overrule: the Pass's new design; the accordion's count; the tiles chapter's copy.

## The verdict map (every answer of the batch; this lane wires only its own board's)

**`guest-shape` r1 (seven; five wire now, `chrome` goes to round two, `dialogs` follows the sheet ruling):**
- `door=today` (overrules `one`): the welcome, then the gate: two screens on a gated event stay. "To be clear, this is
  directly approving the welcome then gate, not this sheet design": the SEQUENCE is ruled, the shell is not; with
  `dialogs=stands` the shell is the one responsive Sheet the hub landed (a bottom sheet in a hand). At a desk a door is
  not a side panel: the Sheet gains a `desk` prop (`side` | `center`) so the door wears the same primitive centred.
- `nothing=river`: the river, at one depth, on both the locked page and the empty album (nine local stand-in frames,
  never the event's own; a locked page leaks exactly what it leaks today).
- `chrome=dock` with "warrants a second round": NOT wired now. Round two on `chrome` alone, drawn with Save already
  moved (his `account=after`) and the dock's two remaining actions (Add, Invite): where a guest's actions live so they
  are FOUND on landing ("one of the last places a guest's eye will reach") and REACHABLE deep in the album ("always
  accessible, no matter how deep"). The floating Add pill's fate rides this round.
- `live=land`: a new photograph grows into its column under a glow that fades, the album re-flows around it, nothing
  else moves. The tile's arrival state is the tile's (the glass lane's file); the guest's live gallery sets it.
- `yours=?` with his rule, verbatim: "A guest can delete any photo they've personally uploaded, ever." A product
  feature that does not exist today (the board's options were never / a window / a 'yours' strip): the viewer's Remove
  on a guest's own photographs, forever, under an account; on the same device session for an anonymous guest (the
  only identity there is). A SECURITY-DEFINER RPC that deletes only the caller's own media (the guest row or the
  account, never a client claim), the same purge path as a host delete, never restorable by the host (a person's
  withdrawal is theirs). His to confirm at approval: whether a guest's removal is final for the host too.
- `account=after` (overrules `one`): the account is asked once, at the door; keeping the album becomes a one-tap
  offer after a guest's first photograph lands, not a form above the album. Save leaves the chrome (round two draws
  the chrome without it).
- `dialogs=stands`: Invite, Save, Report and Download all wear the one responsive Sheet (the desk lane conceded it).

**`app-vocabulary` r1 (seven; four wire now, two stand, `gallery-controls` gets a narrow round two):**
- `empty-states=stands`: the earlier ruling (the pulse's designed empty state) decides; nothing new is wired.
- `loading=asneeded`: one shared skeleton primitive wired to exactly the routes with a real pre-paint wait (the
  dashboard, the event hub, the Studio); the dashboard's and the hub's `loading.tsx` become the one component, the
  Studio gains its first (the ROADMAP line closes).
- `tile-grammar=stands` + "If unifying components or keeping them distinct also helps, that's your call": the earlier
  ruling (glass's tiles rule) decides what a tile shows; the CALL is taken: ONE `MediaTile` for every album grid (guest,
  host, bin, profile feeds, selection) with the three marks as state, the desktop hover actions as a per-surface prop
  and select as a mode; the admin's moderation tile stays its own (a report, not an album). Owned by the glass lane,
  which rewrites every tile's marks anyway.
- `bulk-toolbar=icon` + his three notes: icons on both bars (ReviewActions and GalleryBulkBar become one `BulkBar`
  with an actions prop); tooltips open IMMEDIATELY on hover, never delayed; "every action on a photograph lives in the
  lightbox" was a MOBILE rule and the desk keeps hover controls on cards; and the side-by-side tooltip: moving across
  the bar's icons slides one tooltip panel between them (the transitions.dev "page side by side" shape), the delight of
  this lane, reduced motion a plain swap.
- `gallery-controls-home=cluster` + "Am I overriding anything with this answer, or does this work with the glass?":
  NO override, and the desk badge's reasoning was a slip: glass's `row=bar` ruled the host TILE's hover row (like,
  download, hide as one pane of the material); the cluster is the gallery's section header on paper, and wears no
  glass at all. Both hold, in different places. His crowding worry (download,
  tile size, sort, filter, select) is a narrow round two on this board: where the host gallery's five controls live (a
  View menu holding tile size, sort and filter beside the two verbs; the sticky pill row; a control sheet at 375).
- `gallery-controls-persistence=device`: localStorage, per browser, no profile column.
- `confirm-switch=primitive`: one `ConfirmSwitch` owns the glyph and the deferred-open dance; the two hand-rolled
  copies in the settings sheet's uploads section retire into it.

**`seed-avatar` r1 (seven; all wire now, with a bug fixed first and `look` re-asked in round two):**
- The BUG, before anything: "the avatar doesn't fully fill its container, and you can see horizontal edges within";
  "reveals the color underneath the photograph on the edges". Found and fixed in the production `Avatar` (the drawing
  the board reuses), with a contract test that the image covers the disc at 24, 32 and 40 with no gap.
- `look=diagonal` (overrules `orb`): two hues on a diagonal is the working version. His question ("is this the best
  that hashvatar had to offer? The preview ones ... felt much more alive and rich") is round two on `look` alone: three
  richer looks measured against the same three floors (hashvatar's own multi-stop gradient mode as it renders on its
  site, a two-throw mesh, the diagonal with a lit seam), drawn on the wired avatar.
- `the-crowd=full`, `palette=wheel`, `letter=always`: every guest full colour, all 360 degrees, the initial at every
  size in a fitted ink.
- `seed=account` + "ensure the account ID randomness leads to a variety across the color wheel": the account id is
  the seed; the generator's crowd test (a thousand ids fill every 30-degree bucket) becomes the contract on the
  production path, fed real id shapes (UUIDs), so a concentration is a red test.
- `after-upload=under`: the colour waits underneath and the photograph paints over it; `motion=none`: still, always.

**`admin` r1 (seven; all wire now):** the portal opens on the numbers (four figures, a fortnight's trend, the queue
beneath); a rail plus a command palette (the help palette's primitive if it is one); hybrid density (a table for data
on `ui/table.tsx`, a list beside the message for prose inboxes); a state's colour reaches the row (a failed run tints
its row with a leading edge: "Makes it a bit harder to miss"); every destructive act opens one sheet sized to the
damage (the responsive Sheet; only the permanent act makes you type); the health band under the bar on every page with
a chip in the bar, gone on a good day; a 44 px tool bar with a breadcrumb, a live tag, the health chip and an initial.
His three answers on badged asks (`home`, `density`, `chrome`) override app-shape's reach and are echoed there; the
desk lane had written "stands" on all three.

**`app-door` r1 (seven; all wire now, `welcome` re-asked in round two, `return` flagged):**
- `lead=code`: one email field; the same address signs in or creates the account; Google beside it; a password drops
  to a quiet link.
- `surfaces=one` + "any login components that feel similar could be unified into one object worn 4ways": one account
  object with the methods as props and one consent line, each wear passing the reason it asks (the /login page, the
  guest gate's step, the keep-the-album offer after upload, the create-account moment a like opens). The admin's
  second factor stays its own step after the object (a different purpose).
- `welcome=tour` (overrules `first`): the name, then the tour; event creation becomes the tour's closing primary CTA
  (skippable, as in the preview) so the wizard stays its own focused thing. "Could use a huge redesign to feel more
  alive" is round two on `welcome` alone: three tours drawn on the real screens.
- `page=beside`: /login with the product beside it (real photographs on the right half of a laptop, a band above the
  door in a hand).
- `existing=tell` + his note: the same single step, one line naming the address and saying we signed you into the
  account it already had; dismissible; with an action if it was a mistake ("Not you? Sign out" / "Use another email").
- `failure=paths`: the line, shorter, with the recoveries as real buttons under it; a visual redesign inside the lane.
- `return=tap` + "If this is a bad idea, please flag it": FLAGGED, in one sentence: a press that signs anyone in
  without a credential is never acceptable, and a passkey IS a credential, so the option is right exactly as far as
  passkeys reach. The lane wires it as: a passkey registered on the account page ("Sign in faster on this device"),
  offered once after a code sign-in; the /login door shows the one-press button when this device holds one, the Google
  one-press when a Google session is live, and `back`'s welcome-back line with one field otherwise. If Supabase Auth
  has no passkey factor on this tree (the doc check decides), the lane ships `back` and lists passkeys as the follow-up.

**`glass` r2 (two; the board retires at its wiring):** `material=crystal` (overrules the lane's Frost: 4 percent black,
the pane separating by its edges), `edge=double` (a 28 percent lip and a 10 percent hairline all round). The wiring
lane: the `--glass-*` token set and one `.glass` utility; the lightbox's backdrop (the album blurred at half
brightness); the tiles' three marks and the removed chips (with the rose mark carrying its own contrast: no material
saves it over a bright photograph); the host's row as one bar; dark glass on paper; the reel's controls in the one
material (round one's white on the reel is superseded by "one material everywhere", his own words); then `glass`
retires and the material lands in the Library.

## The seam, landed by the Orchestrator on `launch-prep` BEFORE the cut (additive, about forty lines, announced)

PROGRAM.md makes a change two lanes need the Orchestrator's. `MasonryColumns` gains `arrivedIds?: ReadonlySet<string>`
(writes `data-arrived` on the tile box), `canDelete?: (item) => boolean` (gating its existing per-item `onDeleteItem`)
and `prefix?: ReactNode` (one `{prefix}` before the items); `GuestMasonry`, which has no delete today, gains
`onDeleteItem` and `canDelete` and threads `onDeleteCurrent` into its `MediaLightboxLazy`, plus `arrivedIds` and
`prefix`; `MediaLightbox` gains `canDelete?` gating its existing `onDeleteCurrent` (the Trash and its confirm dialog
exist). About thirty-five lines, additive, no behaviour change; one `canDelete` pin added to the lightbox test. The
glass lane rebuilds under these names (and adopts `openId` on `MasonryColumns`, since the guest album opens by id and
the shared grid by index: a thin wrapper without it brings back the shifted-photo bug; named in Lane 1's tests); the
guest lane passes them from `live-gallery.tsx` and never opens a glass file. In the same commit: the `--info` token
pair, and the `floating-layer.test.ts` portal scan told about the coming `ui/command-palette.tsx` if a listed file may
be absent (checked against the test's own rule; otherwise admin-wiring adds the row as its one-line exception after
vocab-wiring lands). Typecheck and the tests green. (If the seam cannot land clean, `guest-wiring` is cut after
`glass-wiring` merges instead.)

## The small batch, synthesized (demo-event r1 and pricing-page r1, the same build; 15 verdicts: 9 confirm, 5 overrule, one `?` with his answer)

**`demo-event` r1 (seven; six wire, `doors` goes to round two, the welcome's design joins guest-shape round two):**
- `arrival=role` + "This welcome screen could be redesigned, but the demo welcome feels more correct for this generic
  guest welcome": the demo's own arrival (whose party this is, that you stand exactly where a guest stands, the one
  thing to try) stays the first screen behind every demo door; its DESIGN is re-asked in guest-shape round two beside
  the door's shell (one welcome, drawn for a real event and for the demo).
- `framing=tag`: a Demo mark beside the wordmark, and the guest header pins to the top so the mark is on every screen.
- `try=turn`: the same upload, then one card under the album's first row ("that is what your guests would see, and
  here is how you get one").
- `next=slot` + "we could also include a closing card below": the blanked Save slot (Save has left the chrome:
  `account=after`) becomes "Start your own" beside Invite in the first screen, AND a closing card below the album.
- `doors=pile` (overrules `named`) + "I'd be curious to see better designs of this ... labeling the QR doesn't look
  very polished in the otherwise text-free visuals": the footer's photo pile becomes the rule for every demo door on
  the marketing site (one object skinned per place, the nav panel's ticket goes) as the working version; round two on
  `doors` alone draws better, text-free designs of that one object.
- `phone=pair`: a code scanned off the laptop opens the same session; what the phone adds appears on the laptop's
  album a second later and the laptop says where it came from (one broadcast channel, the doorbell's, no stored
  bytes).
- `event=one` + his note: one party, curated once; "The app works the same across events".

**`pricing-page` r1 (eight; six wire, `fit` and `phone` go to round two):**
- `opening=plans` (overrules `fork`): the page opens on paper, the plans the opening, no dark hero chapter above the
  cards ("a paper hero makes the pro card feel more premium"). His product note is recorded verbatim (one event
  against many is not Pro's main differentiator; a wedding wants videos and storage) and changes no ruled line: the
  Pro line already leads with videos.
- `pair=pro` + his flip: Free and Pro side by side in two columns above (his words over the option's own text, which
  drew Pro alone), the Event Pass a full-width card beneath, "more beautiful".
- `size=slider` (overrules `rows`): one slider from the smallest room to the largest, the price, the stats and the
  button following the thumb; the monthly/yearly toggle stays ABOVE the slider ("more intuitive/natural").
- `pass=under` (overrules `beside`): the Pass wide beneath the pair, redesigned with the same care as the cards.
- `fit=wall` + "Would like to see a couple more explorations of this 'Find your plan size' component ... Higgsfield
  does a good job (explore https://higgsfield.ai/pricing in code and visually)": today's slider and filling wall
  stays as built (it is the `today` option); round two on `fit` draws two or three designs, one on Higgsfield's split
  (the configuration left, a designed plan card as the result in a frame right), the lane researching that page.
- `sheet=?` with his answer, verbatim: keep the tiles and the table, kill the band; the tiles above "Find your plan
  size" as a dark chapter intro (the hero now paper); the table dark, so no harsh back-to-back chapter transition
  between Find your plan and the FAQ that follows.
- `close=eight` (overrules `four`) + "reduce the count row (5-6 total?)": the folded accordion, five or six items,
  then the closing band; the JSON-LD carries the same items; the FAQ data's split with Help named in the Handoff.
- `phone=swipe` + "I think the demo is broken, so I can't actually see it live. Would like to prove it in the lab
  before passing": NOT wired. The board's `phone` step is repaired in the lab and the ask stays open on the board for
  his eye (round two carries it beside `fit`).

## The ownership rules every lane follows this round

- One manifest owner per path; no two lanes' `owns` overlap, not even by a shared prefix. A second lane's single-line
  edit in another lane's file rides the lane-check exception line of its Handoff ("exceptions and why"), applied AFTER
  syncing past the owner's merge, never before. `merge-lane.sh` aborts only on real git conflicts (same or adjacent
  lines, a delete against a modify), so distinct hunks merge clean; the pre-handoff sync carries the first lane's hunks.
- `ladder-wiring` owns explicit FILES (its real footprint, about seventy: `git grep -lE
  'text-\[(7|8|9|11|13|15|17)px\]|text-\[0\.8rem\]|tracking-\[0\.14em\]' -- src ':!src/app/(dev)'`), never a prefix
  another lane sits under; a file whose only sizes are stock classes equal to a step needs no edit at all.
- The app-shape lanes build on stock classes that EQUAL a step (`text-sm` 14, `text-xs` 12, `text-base` 16,
  `text-[10px]`) and never on the announced step names: Tailwind v4 emits no utility for an undeclared `--text-working`,
  the element silently inherits, and nothing in the gate sees it. The names are a mechanical swap after a lane syncs
  past the ladder's merge, or a follow-up.
- A wiring lane never deletes, renames or breaks the props of a module the lab imports: every module
  `git grep -l "from \"@/" src/app/\(dev\)` resolves to (`filter-chips`, `trash-section`, `storage-meter`, `feed-section`,
  `empty-section-teaser`, `event-card`, `app-shell`, `feed-section-header`, `event-filter-pills`, `review-section`,
  `use-review-triage`, `recently-deleted-grid`, `event-settings/*`, `event-slug-control`, `my-uploads-gallery`,
  `lib/dashboard/filters.ts`, `media-grid`, `host-selection-provider`, `review-actions`, `gallery-actions`, `styled-qr`,
  `host-media-grid`, `export-dialog`, `download-all-button`, `selectable-media-grid`, `review-grid`, `feed-section-empty`,
  `qr-preset-picker`, `enter-event-prompt`, `gallery-empty-state`, `likes-provider`, `password-gate`, and more): a retired file stays on disk with a head comment
  naming the boards that draw it; `AppShell` and `EventCard` props stay backward compatible; `pnpm design:rules` when
  `component-notes.ts`'s AppShell contract changes.
- `docs/systems/host-app.md` is split by heading: `home-wiring` edits inside `## Dashboard landing`, `## Events & the
  create flow`, `## First-time host welcome`; `hub-wiring` inside `## QR designer`, `## Custom event link (slug)`, `## The
  event page`, `## Moderation & curation` and one Reel-card door line in `## Reel curation`; nobody touches the H1, the
  ROLE block or `## See also` (the Orchestrator rewrites the H1 at the record); edits stay inside a section body, never
  on a heading line or the blank line before the next heading; the second lane to land syncs first.
- `src/lib/single-source-policy.test.ts` refuses one UPPER_SNAKE export from two `src/lib` modules: `home-wiring`'s
  `lib/dashboard/*` and `hub-wiring`'s `lib/event/*` never both export a `SECTION_LABEL`; `voice-wiring` deletes the four
  sibling Pro lines rather than re-exporting one.
- `content/help/` and `content/blog/` belong to `voice-wiring` alone. The app-shape lanes change what several help
  articles describe (the dashboard, the event page, sharing, settings): each lists the articles it makes stale in its
  Handoff (help how-tos track shipped reality), and one `help-sync` follow-up (Sonnet) rewrites them after both land.
- Every new door a wiring lane adds (the QR and its mini-modal, the copy button, the list toggle, the menu rows, the
  cards) carries `trackAttrs` as the chrome's doors do; every new component gets its `for` line in
  `rules/component-notes.ts` and a `// @contract-for:` test, so it lands in the Library with its `new` badge
  (`pnpm design:rules`); the sheets, the mini-modal and the table read `ui/floating-layer.ts`.
- ONE responsive Sheet for the product (a side panel at a desk, a bottom sheet in a hand, on `ui/sheet.tsx` with
  `ui/drawer.tsx` retired or folded): `hub-wiring` builds it for settings and sharing, and it is the sheet
  `guest-shape`'s dialogs, `profile-page`'s quick-look and `app-pricing`'s object inherit ("apply this sheet concept
  everywhere"); its contract test is the one others reuse.

**Binds.** The bible (`/design/library`), the contracts of every component under a path you own, and the policies;
Will's notes in the ledger and rulings.md; the ownership rules above; CLAUDE.md's working loop (doc-check via Context7
first: Next 16, Tailwind v4, zod v4 and Supabase SSR drift). `DESIGN_PREVIEW_KEY` rides the environment, never a command
line. Never edit a record doc (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ASSETS.md`, `docs/tracks/orchestrator.md`,
`docs/design/rulings.md`, `docs/reviews/`); a `docs/systems/` fact inside your lane is refined in place and listed below.
Stage explicitly; never `--no-verify` or force-push; the `Co-Authored-By` trailer on every commit.

**Verify on.** For a production lane: the gate on the synced tree (`pnpm design:rules`, the specimen collector
`node "src/app/(dev)/design/gallery/collect-specimens.mjs"`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` with the 8 known warnings, `pnpm test`,
`pnpm build`), each on its own exit code; `pnpm lab:smoke --base http://localhost:<your port>` whole; the surfaces the Handoff is
judged on, local at 1440 and 375 (the Orchestrator red-teams them on the alias). For a lab lane: the board at 1440 and 375 with
reduced motion honoured, `pnpm lab:smoke` whole, `pnpm lab:demo --board <board> --base http://localhost:<your port>` pressing
every step (a backdrop-filter step reports UNPAINTED in headless Chrome: capture it by hand and say so). One process at a
time on this machine; your dev server on your own port, killed by port before a build, a test run and the handoff.

## Questions (what the goal leaves open; a recommended answer each; the Orchestrator relays them and quotes the answer back)

Every one below was TAKEN on its recommendation and built; none stopped the lane. They are here so he can
overrule on the alias.

- **The bar over the paper opening.** `opening=plans` is drawn in the lab with the PAPER header (the board
  renders its own chrome and could choose); production cannot. Bible 16: "a page cannot flip its header from
  inside, the group's layout picks the skin", and globals.css refuses `.dark` inside `.surface-paper`, so the
  (paper) group would buy the white bar and cost the dark tiles, the dark table and the dark FAQ he asked for in
  the same answer. **Taken: the page stays in (cinema) and the cinema bar sits over the paper chapter.** The
  alternative, if he wants the white bar more than the dark chapters, is a route move plus a paper table.
- **Which two questions left the FAQ.** His "5-6 total?" leaves the choice open. **Taken: six** — the four that
  settle money plus expiry and stacking; "Do my guests ever pay or need an account?" and "How big can uploads be?"
  moved to Help (both are in the site FAQ and in `llms-full.txt` still, and the page's subhead already carries
  "No per-guest fees").
- **The Pass's new design.** His brief was "more beautiful" and "more unique as its own option". **Taken: a
  ticket** — one photograph down the left edge (the pair wears stacked prints, the pass wears a frame), the pair's
  own StatRow instead of a bullet spelling the same three numbers, and the dashed stub rule punched with a notch
  at each end.
- **The tiles chapter's copy.** Unchanged: `sheet` moved WHERE the tiles sit, not what they say, and the four
  lines still name exactly where Free ends. **Taken: leave the copy; the round two on `fit` is next door.**
- **The slider's stops are not tappable.** One control, one job: a native range already jumps to wherever its
  track is pressed, and three buttons under it would be the segmented switch again. **Taken: the labels are
  labels.**

## System-doc edits (in place, owned facts only; the Orchestrator reads each by eye)

- `docs/systems/marketing-content.md`, "Pages + their single-sources": a **new `/pricing` bullet** (the page had
  none; its facts lived nowhere). Names the chapter order, why the route stays in (cinema), the slider's stops,
  the ticket, the six-question FAQ feeding the JSON-LD, and `shared-band.tsx` retired on disk.

## Deferred (ROADMAP one-liners, bucket named)

- **Now**: `/pricing` opens on paper but the (cinema) layout pins `themeColor: #040405`, so a phone's browser
  chrome is dark over a white first screen. The layout's own note forbids a per-page `viewport` export; the fix is
  a group-level answer, not a page's.
- **Now**: delete `src/components/marketing/sections/pricing/shared-band.tsx` when the `pricing-page` board
  retires (it is the only thing that still draws it; the product does not).

## Handoff (replaces the chat report)

- Board commit `a93c246e`, pushed; `origin/launch-prep` had moved to `2dcfcf50`, merged in at `1d4d4d1e` (one
  conflict, `docs/design/library.md`, resolved by regenerating it with `pnpm design:rules`).
- Gates on the synced tree, each on its own exit code: `design:rules` 0 · specimens 0 (137 on 98 entries) ·
  `typecheck` 0 · `lint` 0 (8 known warnings) · `test` 0 (283 files, 2996 passed, 1 skipped) · `build` 0 (255
  pages, `/pricing` still static) · `lab:smoke --base http://localhost:3132` 0 (425 checks, 0 failing). No
  `lab:demo`: this lane draws no board.
- Lane check: `git diff --name-only origin/launch-prep...HEAD` =
  `src/app/(marketing)/(cinema)/pricing/page.tsx` · `src/components/marketing/sections/pricing/{plan-cards,pass-card,comparison-table,pricing-faq-data,shared-band}.tsx|ts` ·
  `src/components/marketing/sections/pricing/{plan-cards-contract.test.tsx,pricing-page.test.ts}` ·
  `docs/systems/marketing-content.md` — plus four outside `owns`, each the gate's own demand:
  `src/app/(dev)/design/rules/rules.generated.json` and `docs/design/library.md` (generated by `pnpm design:rules`,
  the gate's first step); `src/app/(dev)/design/rules/component-notes.ts` (+7 lines: the `for` line a new contract
  requires, in its own new block so a second lane lands on a distinct hunk); `src/lib/type-ladder-policy.test.ts`
  (-5 lines: the `plan-cards.tsx` body exception deleted, since its two hand-set uppercase trackings are on
  `text-label` now — the allow-list that only shrinks); `src/lib/content/llms.test.ts` (one assertion read off
  `FAQ_ITEMS.length + PRICING_FAQ_ITEMS.length` instead of a hardcoded 16, which the FAQ trim turned red).
- The items, one line each:
  - `opening=plans`: wired. The PageHero is gone; the page opens on one PaperChapter, the ruled line at the
    chapter step with the plans under it, the h1 ungated (bible 13) and first paint the words. The cinema bar
    over paper is the one thing his capture did not show (above).
  - `pair=pro` + his flip: wired as no change to the layout. His flip (Free and Pro side by side, the Pass a
    full-width card beneath) IS what ships today, so the pair keeps its ink inversion and its photo stacks.
  - `size=slider`: wired. `SizeSlider` in `plan-cards.tsx` is a real `input[type=range]` whose stops are
    `plansForTier("pro")` (a fourth Pro size appears on it the day it appears in the table); the fill is painted
    into the track, the thumb swells while held and nothing else animates (dragging is high-frequency); the
    cadence toggle stays above it. Lands in the Library as the `plan-cards.tsx` entry with three guards.
  - `pass=under`: wired, redrawn as a ticket (above). `StatRow` is now EXPORTED from `plan-cards.tsx` and
    imported by `pass-card.tsx` rather than copied.
  - `sheet` (his own answer): wired. `SharedBand` off the page (the file kept with a head comment naming the
    board that draws it), `UnlockGrid` opens the dark chapter, `ComparisonTable` lost its PaperChapter and the
    matrix's portaled tooltip carries `portalSkinProps("cinema")` now (a portal cannot read the room it opened
    from).
  - `close=eight` at his count: wired at six, one list still feeding the accordion AND the `FaqPage` JSON-LD.
  - `fit=wall`: untouched, as the brief says (the today option; round two draws the Higgsfield split).
  - `phone=swipe`: untouched. Not wired, by his own note.
- Calls his to overrule on the alias, one line each:
  - The cinema bar over the paper opening (the route-group question above) and, with it, the dark browser-chrome
    tint on the first screen.
  - The Pass as a photographic ticket, and `wedding-petals` as its frame.
  - Six questions, and the two that moved to Help.
  - The slider's look: a 6 px track in the ink card's white at 20 percent, a 20 px thumb, the three sizes named
    under it in the floor step. At the first stop the track is empty by construction.
  - `StatRow` on `text-label` (12 on 0.08em) where it was a hand-set 10 on 0.14em: the stat and badge labels are
    a rung larger and calmer than they were this morning.
- The help articles this lane makes stale: **none rewritten, two now carry more of the load** —
  `content/help/what-you-can-upload.mdx` and `content/help/how-guests-join-and-upload.mdx` /
  `require-accounts-to-upload-explained.mdx` are where the two dropped FAQ answers now live. Both already answer
  them; a `help-sync` lane needs to do nothing unless he wants the pricing page to link them.
- Assets requested from Will: none. The Pass's frame is an existing library image (`wedding-petals`).
- Proposed migrations / Worker / Vercel / Stripe / env changes: none. Checkout targets are untouched and Stripe
  stays TEST.
- Look at first: **/pricing at 1440, the first screen** — the cinema bar over the paper chapter is the call worth
  ten seconds before anything else. Then the Event Pass card (the notches read at both widths), then drag the Pro
  slider through its three stops and watch the price, the stats and the button follow, then the run from the
  tiles to the FAQ with no paper in it. At 375: the pair stacks, the Pass stacks photo-first, and the notches
  move to the card's left and right edges.
