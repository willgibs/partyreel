# lp/light

**Goal.** Rebuild the light board as a catalog, on Will's round-five answers (`docs/reviews/light.json`:
the kit lands as written (`kit=land`), the infusion begins at phase 1 (`infusion=phase-1`), the aurora's
register is Accent (`register=accent`: "Identity feels way too weak"), and two asks he marked not clear
even in plain words, the aurora's first landing (`aurora`) and the depth cues in dark (`depth`): those two
become things he can SEE and rule on as items or as a two-way compare, never a question with token
options again). The items are the twelve treatments the board carries, each a card that is the real
section wearing the treatment at true size with its own Replay and four facts (where it lands, what it
costs in frame time, its register, its rest state); the compare section puts one real section under two
treatments at once; Pick applies the treatment's block to the site (the existing apply path) and the real
pages wear it below. The asks that survive: the infusion order, the lamp's clock, the paper lamp set, the
publish flourish's colour; each still with its context and options in words. The board today weighs
10,164 words outside its folds, the heaviest but one; it must come in under the budget.

**Binds.** The bible, the contracts of every component under a path you own, and the policies;
everything else is precedent (`docs/design/README.md#what-binds-you`). Will's rulings in
`docs/design/rulings.md`: 2026-09-15 (a question carries its context; an exploration is a catalog) and
2026-09-16 (a track returns a catalog to rule on item by item; the Library owns every design fact). His
round-four notes on every board (`docs/reviews/_window.json`): page-wide controls always on screen (the
dock); pixel-perfect previews (never zoom, scale or transform a specimen whose size is being judged: the
kit's `Frame` and a 1:1 `Stage`); more real UI (live production components and whole real pages as the
comparison surfaces, not a screen of specimens); the app's UI is open to this track. No em-dashes in any
copy. No mono.

**The shape every catalog takes** (the palette board is the model: read `sandbox/palette/spec.ts` and
`board.tsx`, then `/design/lab/kit`, the toolbox, before writing a line). `spec.ts` writes the items out
as `const ITEMS` (each: `id` one lower-case token, `name`, `one` at most `LIMITS.candidateOne` characters,
the builder's `verdict` (`ship | refine | kill`), `facts` as four `[label, value]` pairs, the rationale
folded under it), `candidates: ITEMS`, `catalog: { section, control, compare: ["compare-a", "compare-b"] }`,
a clearable pick control whose default is `none` ("Nothing picked") and two compare controls mapped over
the items (every control id a lower-case data-attribute name; `registry.test.ts` refuses the rest). Three
sections: the catalog (the kit's `Catalog`, one card per item with its live preview on a production
ground, Pick, A, B and the reviewer's `ItemVerdictRow`); any two side by side on real pages
(`CompareTwo`, or `SpotCompare` where one thing is applied to many real places); the real pages wearing
the pick (`FrameRow` and `Frame` at 1:1). Asks only for what is not one item, each still carrying its
context, look and options in words. The argument collapsed under the evidence: the board must pass
`pnpm lab:smoke`'s reading budget (`LIMITS.readingWords`, 1,200 words outside every closed fold,
specimen and paste); a board that truly needs more declares `reading: { words, why }` in its spec and
says why in Handoff. The research prose leaves the board, and `docs/specs/<board>.md` shrinks to the
standing proposal (what is ruled, what is open), never a ledger or a history.

**Verify on.** A local `pnpm dev` (`rm -rf .next/dev` first; the chrome's alert strip means a stale
sheet) at 1440 and 375 with reduced motion honoured; `pnpm lab:smoke --base http://localhost:<port>`
green for this board on both halves (the routes and the reading budget); every item's verdict and note
reaching the desk (`/design/lab`, Start the review) and the composed line at the foot of the board;
`pnpm lab:review --dry 'review <board> r<n>: item:<id>=keep'` accepting it; `registry.test.ts`,
`lab-review.test.ts` and the board's own tests green; the four gates.

**Discipline on this machine.** Four agents at once is the ceiling (36 GB; eleven crashed it): one
process at a time; stop your dev server before `pnpm build` or `pnpm test`; start it on a port of your
own and kill it by PORT (`lsof -tiTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs kill`), never an unscoped `pkill`;
close browser tabs you are not using; kill your server before handing off; never `[preview]` or `[ci]`
in a commit message; stage files explicitly; the `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
trailer on every commit. The dev server on :3000 is Will's.

**Questions.** What the goal leaves open goes here, numbered, with your recommended answer; carry on
with the recommendation. Never guess at a product decision without writing the question down.

## System-doc edits (in place, owned facts only; the Orchestrator reads each by eye)

- none yet

## Deferred (ROADMAP one-liners, bucket named)

- none yet

## Handoff (replaces the chat report)

- Head <sha>, pushed; synced with launch-prep at <sha> (or: it had not moved)
- Gates on the synced tree: typecheck ok, lint ok, test ok (N), build ok (M pages); `pnpm lab:smoke` green for this board, its reading words
- Lane check: `git diff --name-only origin/launch-prep...HEAD` = owned paths + this file (exceptions and why)
- The items, one line each: `<id>: <the builder's verdict>; a kept one becomes <the Library entry it lands as>`
- The asks that survive, one line each, and why each is not one item
- Assets requested from Will: none, or one per line: `what · spec (size, grade, count, format) · replaces <stand-in id>`
- Proposed migrations / Worker / Vercel / Stripe / env changes: none
- Look at first: ...

## Record (one paragraph, past tense, at most eight lines; the Orchestrator fills the merge SHA)

Merged into `launch-prep` at `<sha>` (<date>). ...
