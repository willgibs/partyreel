# lp/floating-surfaces

**Goal.** Rebuild the floating-surfaces board as a catalog: the items are the directions (Today, Card,
Glass, Command, and any other the board carries that is still a real direction), each a card showing
the event menu at 328 wide on the production ground with one line and four facts (the radius, the
entrance, the light, the shadow model); the compare section puts the host's desk (the real dashboard in
a `Frame` at 1:1) under two directions at once; Pick is the existing `direction` control made clearable
with `none` as its default; the real pages wear the pick below. The asks that survive are the submenu,
the radius, the entrance and the light, each still with its context and options in words; the outliers
and the anatomy ladders fold under the evidence or go. The sweep found (2026-09-16) that a board's own
sheet must never pull a row past the content column at 1:1 (the shell clips a bleed at the window edge
now). The board today weighs 5,040 words outside its folds; it must come in under the budget.

**Binds.** The bible, the contracts of every component under a path you own, and the policies;
everything else is precedent (`docs/design/README.md#what-binds-you`). Will's rulings in
`docs/design/rulings.md`: 2026-09-15 (a question carries its context; an exploration is a catalog) and
2026-09-16 (a track returns a catalog to rule on item by item; the Library owns every design fact). His
round-four notes on every board (`docs/reviews/_window.json`): page-wide controls always on screen (the
dock); pixel-perfect previews (never zoom, scale or transform a specimen whose size is being judged: the
kit's `Frame` and a 1:1 `Stage`); more real UI (live production components and whole real pages as the
comparison surfaces, not a screen of specimens); the app's UI is open to this track. No em-dashes in any
copy. No mono.

**The shape every catalog takes** (the palette board is the model: read `sandbox/palette/spec.ts` and
`board.tsx`, then `/design/lab/kit`, the toolbox, before writing a line). `spec.ts` writes the items out
as `const ITEMS` (each: `id` one lower-case token, `name`, `one` at most `LIMITS.candidateOne` characters,
the builder's `verdict` (`ship | refine | kill`), `facts` as four `[label, value]` pairs, the rationale
folded under it), `candidates: ITEMS`, `catalog: { section, control, compare: ["compare-a", "compare-b"] }`,
a clearable pick control whose default is `none` ("Nothing picked") and two compare controls mapped over
the items (every control id a lower-case data-attribute name; `registry.test.ts` refuses the rest). Three
sections: the catalog (the kit's `Catalog`, one card per item with its live preview on a production
ground, Pick, A, B and the reviewer's `ItemVerdictRow`); any two side by side on real pages
(`CompareTwo`, or `SpotCompare` where one thing is applied to many real places); the real pages wearing
the pick (`FrameRow` and `Frame` at 1:1). Asks only for what is not one item, each still carrying its
context, look and options in words. The argument collapsed under the evidence: the board must pass
`pnpm lab:smoke`'s reading budget (`LIMITS.readingWords`, 1,200 words outside every closed fold,
specimen and paste); a board that truly needs more declares `reading: { words, why }` in its spec and
says why in Handoff. The research prose leaves the board, and `docs/specs/<board>.md` shrinks to the
standing proposal (what is ruled, what is open), never a ledger or a history.

**Verify on.** A local `pnpm dev` (`rm -rf .next/dev` first; the chrome's alert strip means a stale
sheet) at 1440 and 375 with reduced motion honoured; `pnpm lab:smoke --base http://localhost:<port>`
green for this board on both halves (the routes and the reading budget); every item's verdict and note
reaching the desk (`/design/lab`, Start the review) and the composed line at the foot of the board;
`pnpm lab:review --dry 'review <board> r<n>: item:<id>=keep'` accepting it; `registry.test.ts`,
`lab-review.test.ts` and the board's own tests green; the four gates.

**Discipline on this machine.** Four agents at once is the ceiling (36 GB; eleven crashed it): one
process at a time; stop your dev server before `pnpm build` or `pnpm test`; start it on a port of your
own and kill it by PORT (`lsof -tiTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs kill`), never an unscoped `pkill`;
close browser tabs you are not using; kill your server before handing off; never `[preview]` or `[ci]`
in a commit message; stage files explicitly; the `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
trailer on every commit. The dev server on :3000 is Will's.

**Questions.** What the goal leaves open goes here, numbered, with your recommended answer; carry on
with the recommendation. Never guess at a product decision without writing the question down.

## System-doc edits (in place, owned facts only; the Orchestrator reads each by eye)

- none yet

## Deferred (ROADMAP one-liners, bucket named)

- none yet

## Handoff (replaces the chat report)

- Head <sha>, pushed; synced with launch-prep at <sha> (or: it had not moved)
- Gates on the synced tree: typecheck ok, lint ok, test ok (N), build ok (M pages); `pnpm lab:smoke` green for this board, its reading words
- Lane check: `git diff --name-only origin/launch-prep...HEAD` = owned paths + this file (exceptions and why)
- The items, one line each: `<id>: <the builder's verdict>; a kept one becomes <the Library entry it lands as>`
- The asks that survive, one line each, and why each is not one item
- Assets requested from Will: none, or one per line: `what · spec (size, grade, count, format) · replaces <stand-in id>`
- Proposed migrations / Worker / Vercel / Stripe / env changes: none
- Look at first: ...

## Record (one paragraph, past tense, at most eight lines; the Orchestrator fills the merge SHA)
