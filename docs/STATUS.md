# Partyreel — Status

> **You-are-here, short and current.** What's live, what's pending a human, what's in flight.
> For the feature map read [`SYSTEMS.md`](SYSTEMS.md); for backlog/deferred work + the
> pick-up-a-task loop read [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); for how to work in the repo read
> [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

**Updated:** 2026-05-31

## Where we are

**The v1 foundation is built and verified in production.** The focused phased roadmap is
complete — the project is now in **one-off task mode** (a goal → its own small plan → build →
verify on partyreel.com → record). Shipped + live-verified: host auth, the create wizard + QR
designer + first-time welcome, guest join/upload, galleries, moderation + the purge-cron
lifecycle, the storage-cap tier model + Stripe (Pro subs, Event Pass, portal), the growth loop
(branded share/SEO/guest email capture), link analytics, the notification center, the album
lightbox + per-item download, and the **unified live guest event page** (live polling gallery +
in-page share). Full map in [`SYSTEMS.md`](SYSTEMS.md). Canonical domain **partyreel.com**; R2 bucket `partyreel`
provisioned (CORS `ExposeHeaders: ETag` + abort-incomplete-multipart rule).

**Only scaffolded:** Phase 5 — the highlight reel (DB scaffold only; the *build* stays tabled
pending a product + architecture decision — see ROADMAP). Its **marketing framing is now
confirmed** (2026-05-31): a core value prop — an auto-compiled, host-customizable, shareable/
downloadable reel of the event's favorite moments — featured as such on the new site.

## In flight / pending verification

- **Marketing site full build-out — Rounds 1–2 done locally, NOT yet deployed.**
  Expanding the scaffolded marketing site to a launch-ready full site (Features / Use cases / Help
  / Contact / Careers / Blog), designed as-if-complete (7-round plan in `.claude/plans/`). R1
  landed the IA + design foundation: a `marketing-nav.ts` single-source, a config-driven header
  (dropdown-capable) + a real mobile `Sheet` menu (there was none), a multi-column footer,
  Org/Website JSON-LD + a shared `SITE_URL`/brand constant, and two **global, shared-with-the-app**
  changes — the **#FB4817** accent (replaces the old coral) + a wider `Container` (`max-w-7xl`).
  Verified via Preview MCP (accent = exact `rgb(251,72,23)`, desktop nav + mobile Sheet + footer,
  no console errors; typecheck/lint/113 tests clean). **Round 2** added `/features` (capability
  deep-dive; `features.ts` single-source feeding the home teaser too) + elevated the highlight reel
  to a confident marquee (video-player frame), plus a global **Inter** type refresh with tighter
  heading tracking (both shared with the app). Rounds 3–7 next.
- **Unified guest event page** (`/e/[qr_token]`) — **shipped + deployed** (commit `f073451`):
  header + just-in-time upload + a **live polling gallery** + in-page QR/share, all driven by the
  host's `is_public`/`accepting_uploads` state. Verified on **partyreel.com**: render + native
  Share (feature-detected) + the **live poll** (an injected approved photo appeared at the top
  within ~12 s, no reload) + the QR-enlarge dialog; and on localhost the **3-state matrix**
  (private-lock / accepting-off / full), the lightbox, and the optimistic-upload path. _(Real
  file-picker uploads can't be driven via the Chrome MCP — the optimistic-tile path is client-only
  logic, verified locally.)_ The album lightbox + per-item download (commit `8a4f3ae`) is also
  fully verified, incl. the host-gallery lightbox + Save while signed in.
- **The email-driven lifecycle flows are deployed but NOT yet live-verified** — over-capacity
  grace→auto-reduce, the Event-Pass renewal nudge ($15 checkout), and free-tier inactivity
  warn/remove all send via Resend, which **isn't configured yet** (see below). Verify each once
  `EMAIL_FROM` + a sending domain are set (a test email arrives + doesn't re-send; the
  grace/renewal/inactivity transitions fire).
- _(Test data on prod is disposable — host test account `willg97@gmail.com` with one "Share Step
  Test" event holding 3 seeded test media from verification; operator/admin `hi@willgibs.com`.)_

## Blocked on a human ("manual instrument")

The agent can't do these — they need a human in a dashboard:

- **Resend** — set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` (`Partyreel <noreply@partyreel.com>`, no
  quotes in Vercel) + **verify a sending domain (DNS)**. Until then transactional email is dark.
- **Stripe test → live (before launch)** — re-create products/prices in LIVE + swap the 5 env
  vars to `sk_live_…` / live `whsec_` / live price IDs (code needs no change). Checklist:
  [`PRICING.md`](PRICING.md) "Test → Live cutover". _(Currently TEST mode, verified.)_
- **`MONTHLY_INGRESS_BYTES.pro`** is still `null` (unmetered) — tune it before Pro launch.
- **Supabase CLI** isn't installed locally; migrations are applied via the **Supabase MCP**
  (`apply_migration`). To use `pnpm db:types` / `db:push`, install the CLI +
  `supabase link --project-ref ddafaemglzmuekbtjwzn`.

**Already done (don't redo):** R2 bucket + creds + CORS + lifecycle rule, the apex
`partyreel.com` domain, `CRON_SECRET` (Vercel), `profiles.is_admin = true` for the operator, and
the Stripe **TEST** products/prices + webhook endpoint + Billing Portal + the 5 env vars.

## After any change

Advance this file, the [`SYSTEMS.md`](SYSTEMS.md) entry if a feature changed, and the
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) box/backlog — same change. Re-run `get_advisors` after DDL (the
expected set is the 7 anon capability RPCs + the deny-all INFOs + the unrelated leaked-password
WARN — see SYSTEMS "Security & data model").
