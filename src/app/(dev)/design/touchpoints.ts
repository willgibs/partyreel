/**
 * THE RULINGS REGISTRY of the design lab (thinned in the library round, 2026-09-02).
 *
 * One entry per ruling the lab has taken: what shipped, why in one line, and
 * where the rule lives now. The long record (the ruling verbatim, the round's
 * context, the board's files and last SHA) is docs/decisions/design-record.md,
 * anchored by these ids and rendered at /design/record. The rules a reader must
 * obey live in the system docs named in `lives`, never here.
 *
 * `board` is set ONLY while a board still stands in sandbox/ (its ruling is
 * open). When the ruling lands: the rule moves to its system doc, the record doc
 * keeps the history, the board is deleted, and `board` goes with it. SANDBOX and
 * the sidebar derive from that, so this file is the one place a board is added
 * or retired. The touchpoint dispatcher (c/[touchpoint]/page.tsx) maps the same
 * four ids to their components.
